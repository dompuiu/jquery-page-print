# jQuery Page Print
This plugin shows a print preview of the current page in a modal window.
The plugin is inspired from the [jQuery Print Preview plugin](https://github.com/etimbo/jquery-print-preview-plugin).

The plugins also tries to capture the "CTRL + P" keybinding. The modal window is shown when you press "CTRL + P" for the first time. While the modal is opened, pressing the "CTRL + P" keys will open the print window of the browser.
Unlike traditional print previews this plugin brings in all content and print styles within a modal window.

The icons used in the plugin were taken from the [FatCow Web Hosting Icon Set](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).
